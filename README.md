# 💫 About Me
Hi, I'm Fakhri Fitra Perdana, a passionate FullStack and Mobile Developer with experience in building scalable web and mobile applications. I specialize in React, React Native, Next.js, Node.js, Express, and Go, and I enjoy exploring new technologies and solving challenging problems.  

I have a strong interest in **cloud computing, database management, and real-time applications**, and I love integrating APIs and services to create efficient and user-friendly solutions. In my projects, I focus not only on functionality but also on maintainable and clean code.  
When I'm not coding, I enjoy **learning about AI, IoT, and hardware programming**, tinkering with Arduino and ESP32 devices. I'm always looking to collaborate with other developers and work on projects that make a meaningful impact.  

Currently, I'm working on personal projects, experimenting with full-stack architectures, and enhancing my skills in mobile development and cloud technologies. I'm open to opportunities where I can grow as a developer, contribute to innovative projects, and learn from a community of talented engineers.
